# Dehaze-Enhanced-Training-for-Missile-Detection-Using-YOLOv8
This project enhances missile detection using YOLOv8 by applying image dehazing as a preprocessing step. Dehazing improves image clarity in foggy or smoky conditions, boosting detection accuracy. The model is trained and tested on both original and dehazed images from a Roboflow dataset.
